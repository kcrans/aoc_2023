# 🎄🎄🎄 Advent of Code 2023 🎄🎄🎄 
These are my solutions for the 2023 set of Advent of Code challenges all written in python. They can be found in a given day's directory under the filename dayXX.py using 
data from dayXX.txt. I tried to write clear and efficient code, with comprehensive comments whenever the reasoning was nontrivial. The algorithms were my focus this year, but I did use some fun python features too.
